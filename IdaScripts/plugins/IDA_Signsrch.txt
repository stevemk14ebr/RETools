IDA Signsrch
===============================================================================
IDA Pro plug-in conversion of Luigi Auriemma's signsrch signature matching
tool.

Version 1.6, July 2018
By Sirmabus

----- [Description] -----------------------------------------------------------

Luigi's original signsrch description:
"Tool for searching signatures inside files, extremely useful as help in
reversing jobs like figuring or having an initial idea of what encryption
compression algorithm is used for a proprietary protocol or file.
It can recognize tons of compression, multimedia and encryption algorithms and
many other things like known strings and anti-debugging code which can be also
manually added since it's all based on a text signature file read at runtime
and easy to modify."

By converting his tool into a plug-in, it allows it to be run directly in an
IDA Pro environment.


----- [Install] ---------------------------------------------------------------
Copy the plug-in and signsrch.xml file to your IDA Pro "plugins" directory.

Can be added with a hotkey to your "plugins.cfg" file or run directly from
IDA's "Edit->Plugins" menu.


----- [How to run it] ---------------------------------------------------------
Invoke like any other plug-in in IDA through the hot key, or through the IDA's
Edit->Plugins menu.

You should be presented with the "IDA Signsrch" plug-in dialog.

There are four options:

1) "Alternate endian search.":
What is "endian" you say? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness
By default the plug-in will use the endian based on the IDB (not the current
machine like the exe does).  It is better left unchecked in most circumstances
as otherwise increases the search time about double.
If for some reason the target has opposite endian data, then you want to have
this checked.

If you look in "signsrch.xml" you will see things work as runs of bytes.
You might think endian is not relative but actually it is here because these
patterns are often composed of various other data types (like 32bit, etc).

2) "Output to debug channel.":
With this checked match info will be outputted to the debug out channel.
You can view the output in a tool like Mark Russinovich's DebugView available
at: http://goo.gl/D3P0

3) "Include code segments.":
You normally want this option checked so that signatures can be found in mixed
code/data segments plus there are several relevant unique 32bit size code value
signatures in the DB as well.
Unchecked only data segments (".data", ".rdata", etc) will be searched.

4) "Place signature comments.":
With this checked as signatures are located a comment will be placed
automatically made up of a special tag "#Signsrch "followed by the signature
label name.
If there is an existing comment at the same place, a space will be appended
or a new line first if the comment ia long.

Click on "Continue" to execute.

On completion if any matches are found, it will show them sorted by address in
an IDA list box labeled "[ Signsrch matches ]".
Browse and double click on a line to jump to it's address location.


----- [Design] ----------------------------------------------------------------
I had been wanting to do this project for some time and thought initially it
was going to be a quick easy project since there was source for it.
But after hours of struggling with the parser source, I decided to just rip the
original parser source out and break it off as a separate XML format exporter.


----- [Adding more and editing signatures] ------------------------------------
The XML format is simple and should be mostly self explanatory when viewed in a
text or XML viewer. There is however some tags in the label/title that need
some explanation. In them between two brackets are embedded important details.
The size, endianness, and an optional bit wise stepping value. The format is
'[', optional bits value, '.', endian type "le" or "be" w/optional "rev" for
reverse, '.', the pattern size, then optionally a '&' to indicate the special
bit stepping value, then a ']' to close.
Example: "[32.le.56]" means 32 bits, little endian, with a pattern size of 56
bytes.
Another: "MD5 digest [32.be.272&amp;]" code in there  means 32 bit stepping
(the "&amp;"), big endian, and a pattern size of 272 bytes.
Note in my XML form the bit field ("TYPE" in original format) is only relevant
when the '&' granularity stepping flag is present.

To add more patterns one can either edit "signsrch.xml", or edit the source
"signsrch.sig" in it's original formatting style then run it with the included
"Signsrch2XML.exe" utility to convert it over.
Just put the "signsrch.sig" file in the same folder as Signsrch2XML and run it,
then copy the resulting XML file over to your IDA plugins folder.

See the comments at the top of "signsrch.sig" for more information on it's
formatting.


----- [Change log] ------------------------------------------------------------

      2) Removed most of the custom memory alignment allocator stuff since it's
         no longer relevant.

1.4 - 1) Updated to IDA SDK 6.8 version.
      2) Added a 64bit "EA64" version.

      2) Updated and fixed custom UI elements.

1.2 - Minor clean up of GUI customizations.
